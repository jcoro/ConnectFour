# ConnectFour
This App was a project for Udacity's [Intro To Java Programming Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-java-programming--cs046).  The goal was to create a program (i.e., an "Agent") to place moves in an automated ConnectFour Game. For example:
[Agent2](https://github.com/jcoro/ConnectFour/blob/master/MyAgent2.java)

## Implementation
The program includes a [Game Simulator](https://github.com/jcoro/ConnectFour/blob/master/GameSimulator.java) to run many games at the click of a button.

For step-by-step games with a visual interface, there is a [Main] (https://github.com/jcoro/ConnectFour/blob/master/Main.java)  class as well.

To Run either from [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/), Right Click Class, select `void main(String[] args)`. Then click OK as shown below.

NOTE: in the Main.java and GameSimulator.java files linked above, make sure to replace the "Agent Names" for both the Agents you create, and to test against the RandomAgent, BeginnerAgent, IntermediateAgent, AdvancedAgent, and BrilliantAgent already included.

If you have any questions I'd be happy to try and help. Please contact me at: john@coronite.net.
